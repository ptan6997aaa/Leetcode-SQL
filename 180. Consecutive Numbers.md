```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH row_before_table AS (

        num, 
        LAG(num, 1) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS one_row_before,  
        LAG(num, 2) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS two_row_before 
    FROM Logs     
)
SELECT DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums  
FROM row_before_table 
WHERE num = one_row_before AND one_row_before = two_row_before
